# Git & Github Professional

## 1- The perfect commit

the bigger the commit contains main topics and changes, the harder it is to understand it.

**rules :**

    1- only combine changes from the same topic in one commit
    if you made more than one change in one file, but those changes are not related to the same topic so you need to split them into multiple commits by using those commands:

    ```
    git add -p   //-p stands for patch
    ```
    then it will show you the hunks of the file and you can choose which hunk you want to add to the staging area

    2- the message
    - the subject should be a brief summary of the changes
    - the body should be a detailed explanation of the changes

## 2- Branching strategies
