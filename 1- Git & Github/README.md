# Git & Github

## 1- Git & Github introduction

### What is Git..?

Git is a Version control software that allows save each time you make a change so if you make a mistake or you want to update some thing you can look back and update that or undo the change you have done

### What is GitHub..?

Github is a collaboration website that interacts with git

## Github Hub Workflow

When start working on a project, this project stored in a repository,all the code found in a branch called master we don't want to make changes direct to the master branch

- **Branching :**
  creating branch from the master is like making an exact replica of the master branch, so you have a safe sandbox to make changes without affecting the master

- **Commits :**
  making a commit is like saving the changes you have made by taking a snapshot at that point of time

- **Pull request :**
  comparing the branch you made with another branch it gives you an oportunity to look at the differences between those two branches and show other people those differences

- **Collaborate :**
  giving a feedback on that pull request (you to others or others to you)

- **Merge :**
  once you are in a good place then you merge, when you merging you take the branch and commits you made and put them back to the master

## Github Hub Workflow for Open Source

if you are working on a project that you don't have a collaborator access to

- **Fork :**
  create am exact copy of another repositpry but under your account so you have a right access
